# Design System Inspired by Mastercard

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

Mastercard's experience reads like a warm, editorial magazine built from soft stone and signal orange. The canvas is a muted putty-cream (`#F3F0EE`) — not white, not gray, but a color that feels like the paper of a premium annual report. On top of that canvas, everything that matters is shaped like a stadium, a pill, or a perfect circle. The dominant visual gesture is the **oversized radius**: heroes carry 40-point corners, cards go fully pill-shaped, service images are cropped into circular orbits, and buttons either complete the pill or fit snugly at 20 points. There are almost no sharp corners anywhere on the page.

The second gesture is **orbit and trajectory**. Circular image masks don't sit still — they're connected by thin, hand-drawn-feeling orange arcs that span entire viewport widths, implying a constellation of services rather than a list. Each circle has a small attached "satellite" — a white micro-CTA holding an arrow icon — docked onto its perimeter like a moon. This is the most distinctive thing about Mastercard's current design language: the circles feel like they're in motion even though the page is still.

Typography is rendered entirely in **MarkForMC**, Mastercard's proprietary geometric sans. Headlines are set at a medium weight (500) with tight negative letter-spacing (-2%), giving them confidence without shouting. Body copy runs at the same family in a slightly lighter weight (450) — a weight you rarely see on the web, chosen because it reads softer than regular 400 without feeling thin. The whole system — warm cream surfaces, pill shapes, circular portraits, traced-orange orbits, black CTAs — feels simultaneously institutional (a 60-year-old payments network) and editorial (a modern brand magazine), which is exactly the tension Mastercard wants to hold.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Warm cream canvas (`#F3F0EE`) replaces traditional white — every surface is tinted, never sterile
- Extreme border-radius as design language: 40px, 99px, 1000px dominate; anything square is a cookie-banner third-party
- Circular image portraits with attached white satellite-CTAs and traced-orange orbital paths
- Ghost "watermark" headlines (cream-on-cream text at heading scale) layered behind circle portraits
- Black primary CTAs with 20px radius in the body — the cookie-banner orange is kept to consent flows
- Floating pill-shaped navigation that docks below the viewport top with rounded shoulders
- Eyebrow labels with a tiny accent dot + uppercase bold tracking — used as the section-category signal
- Dark warm-black footer (`#141413`) with four-column link layout and large conversational headline

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

### Primary
- **Mastercard Red** (`#EB001B`): The left circle of the Mastercard mark — used only in the brand logo, never as a UI color.
- **Mastercard Yellow** (`#F79E1B`): The right circle of the Mastercard mark — used only in the brand logo, never as a UI color.
- **Ink Black** (`#141413`): The warm near-black used for primary CTAs, headline text on cream, and the footer surface. Slightly warm (the `13` blue value pulls toward the cream) so it never feels jet-black on the warm canvas.

### Secondary & Accent
- **Signal Orange** (`#CF4500`): The burnt/rust CTA orange used on consent actions and eyebrow dots. Deeper than the brand yellow, brighter than ink — it's the page's single aggressive color and must be used sparingly.
- **Light Signal Orange** (`#F37338`): A lighter carroty orange used for carousel active indicators and decorative orbital arcs. Always acts as an attention cue, never as body color.
- **Clay Brown** (`#9A3A0A`): The deep rust used for secondary link-style buttons (e.g., cookie details). Sits between ink and signal orange.

### Surface & Background
- **Canvas Cream** (`#F3F0EE`): The page canvas. Warm, putty-toned, the default body background. All editorial sections sit on this.
- **Lifted Cream** (`#FCFBFA`): One step lighter than canvas — used for nested "raised" sections that want to feel like paper laid on paper.
- **White** (`#FFFFFF`): Reserved for the floating navigation pill, modal cards, secondary button fills, and small satellite-CTA circles attached to image portraits.
- **Soft Bone** (`#F4F4F4`): A cool-gray alternative surface used inside a handful of component subregions.

### Neutrals & Text
- **Ink Black** (`#141413`): Primary headline and body text color.
- **Charcoal** (`#262627`): A slightly softer black used for some text alternates.
- **Slate Gray** (`#696969`): Muted secondary text — eyebrow label alternative, disabled states, "Privacy Choices" bottom-row text.
- **Granite** (`#555555`) and **Graphite** (`#565656`): Deeper gray for inline body accents and link alternates.
- **Dust Taupe** (`#D1CDC7`): Very muted cream-gray used for disabled or "whisper" text (e.g., placeholder-like empty state labels). Low contrast on cream; use only for subdued content.

### Semantic & Accent
- **Link Blue** (`#3860BE`): A deep, slightly dusty blue used for inline links and informational callouts. Saturated enough to read as a link without being neon.
- **Priceless Red + Yellow**: The full-color Mastercard logo mark is the only place the brand's red and yellow appear together; they lock the identity to the page without acting as a UI palette.

### Gradient System
Mastercard uses no programmatic gradients in the core UI. The visual impression of "gradient" comes from two places:
- **Circular image portraits** where a warm-orange photo subject (a card, a sunflower, a beverage) fades to the cream canvas at its edge
- **Deep card shadows** on elevated content (`rgba(0,0,0,0.08) 0px 24px 48px`) that create a soft halo beneath pill-shaped media

## 3. Typography Rules

### Font Family
- **Primary**: `MarkForMC` — Mastercard's proprietary geometric sans. Every headline, body paragraph, button, nav link, and footer link on the page.
- **Secondary**: `MarkOffcForMC` — an "Official" cut used in a minority of contexts (legal text, some forms).
- **Fallback stack**: `SofiaSans, Arial, sans-serif` — Sofia Sans is a reasonable open-source stand-in; Arial is the final web-safe fallback.

### Hierarchy

| Role | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| H1 (hero) | 64px | 500 | 64px | -1.28px (-2%) | Set to `1:1` line-height for very tight vertical rhythm on multi-line hero |
| H2 (section) | 36px | 500 | 44px | -0.72px (-2%) | Used in ghost-watermark headline treatments and section titles |
| H3 (card title) | 24px | 500 | 28.8px (1.2) | -0.48px (-2%) | Titles inside service/solution cards |
| H4 (subhead) | 14px | 700 | 18.2px (1.3) | normal | Rarely used in marketing surfaces |
| Eyebrow (H5) | 14px | 700 | 14px | 0.56px (+4%) | Uppercase, paired with a tiny accent dot (e.g., "• SERVICES") |
| Body paragraph | 16px | 450 | 22.4px (1.4) | normal | The half-step 450 weight is MarkForMC's signature — softer than 500, firmer than 400 |
| Nav link / Button label | 16px | 500 | 16px | -0.48px (-3%) | Tight, compact, no text-transform |
| Footer link | 14px | 450 | ~20px | normal | Lighter weight on dark footer for airier density |
| Footer column header | 12–14px | 700 | 14px | 0.56px (+4%) | Uppercase, muted gray, short tracking |

### Principles
- **Weight 450 is load-bearing**. Most brands use 400/500/700; Mastercard uses 450 for body copy, which creates an unusually soft reading tone. Replacing it with 400 flattens the identity.
- **Tight negative tracking on headlines** (-2%) gives display text its editorial density — the words lock together rather than breathe.
- **Uppercase tracking only on the eyebrow scale** (14px / 700 / +4% tracking). Don't use uppercase anywhere else; no shouty section titles.
- **One-font system**. Resist the urge to add a second typeface for contrast. The contrast comes from scale, weight, and letter-spacing, not from a serif or display accent.
- **Line-height ratio drops with size**. H1 is 1:1, H3 is 1.2, body is 1.4. Tight display, comfortable reading.

### Note on Font Substitutes
MarkForMC is proprietary and licensed. When rebuilding a matching aesthetic without access to the original:
- **Sofia Sans** (Google Fonts) is the closest open-source match — it's already in Mastercard's declared fallback stack.
- **Inter** at weights 450/500/700 works as a generic stand-in; expect slightly taller x-height and looser letter shapes.
- **Neue Haas Grotesk** or **Geist** can approximate the geometric feel for commercial projects.
- Whichever substitute is used, preserve the **-2% letter-spacing on headlines** and the **450 body weight** (use `font-weight: 450` with variable fonts, or substitute `font-weight: 400` and tighten the letter-spacing by ~-0.5% to compensate).

## 4. Component Stylings

### Buttons

**Primary — Ink Pill**
